Hoster is a plugin for TiddlyWeb that hosts TiddlyWikis.

It aggregates a lot of functionality to explore how multi-user
TiddlyWiki hosting might work. It is a prototype and is not 
intended to be a complete system with an excellent UI. Instead
it explores the structure of the application to see where there
are gaps, patterns, opportunities.

You can help by trying it out.

You can make a new hoster instance, once the package has been
installed, with the 'betsy' command:

 $ betsy place
 $ cd place
 $ twanager server
 $ open http://0.0.0.0:8080/
